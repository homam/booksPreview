                        Giving someone a compliment makes them feel good. This then makes them more open to your ideas.<br>
                        A compliment can make people happy long after it is given. Many people remember a compliment for years after it was told to them.<br>
                        People will remember YOUR compliment when they feel ‘down’ and they will think of you positively too!

                                A compliment MUST be genuine and honest or people will not believe you. If they don't believe you, they won't trust you!

                        No one likes criticism. It makes people angry and resentful.<br>
                        Most criticism only results in the person being criticised returning the comment or worse, causing further bitterness.<br>
                        Resentment from criticism generally leads to demoralisation and rarely corrects the issue anyway.

                                One of the greatest English writers, Thomas Hardy, author of 'Tess of the D'urbervilles' and 'Far From the Madding Crowd', actually refused to write again after very mean criticism.
